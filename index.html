	<h1> About me </h1>

	<p>
	Hi, Nesh here. I am currently in highschool.
	</p>

	<p>
	I wanted to polish my web designing skills so, I decided to make this site.
	</p>	

	<p>
	I am interested in physics simulations and doing math. Recently I have gotten interested in electronic components and started some projects.
	</p>

	<p>
	Other than that, I watch anime, geopolitics, global issues. I have also started playing Wuthering Waves recently.
